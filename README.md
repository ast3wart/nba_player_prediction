NBA Player Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict NBA player performance, including points scored in games. The system fetches real-time data from the NBA API, processes it, and applies XGBoost models for both regression and classification tasks. The project also includes a Streamlit-based web interface for easy interaction with the predictions.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Required Python Packages

Install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The required packages include:

	•	nba-api
	•	xgboost
	•	streamlit
	•	pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
	•	And other utilities like matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, etc.

The full list is available in requirements.txt ￼.

How to Run

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>


	2.	Run the Prediction Model:
	•	You can run the main prediction script, which handles data collection, feature engineering, and model training.

python main.py


	3.	Launch the Streamlit App:
	•	To interact with the model predictions through a web interface, run:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

This will launch the app on your localhost at http://localhost:8501.

File Structure

	•	main.py: Orchestrates the workflow, including data collection, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
	•	data_collection.py: Fetches player and game log data using the NBA API.
	•	data_preprocessing.py: Cleans and prepares data for model training.
	•	feature_engineering.py: Transforms the data by creating new features.
	•	model_training.py: Handles model training (XGBoost) for both classification and regression.
	•	prediction.py: Uses the trained models to make predictions.
	•	streamlit_app.py: The Streamlit interface for interacting with predictions.
	•	utils.py: Contains utility functions to support the main scripts.

Future Enhancements

	•	Add support for more advanced features such as injury prediction or player fatigue analysis.
	•	Extend the interface to display more detailed prediction visualizations.
